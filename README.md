# Footprint OTP

**Warning! This project is intended to be a tool for me to learn about cryptography. DO NOT USE IT IN PRODUCTION!**

Footprint OTP is an encryption program that uses a simple stream cipher. It performs a bitwise XOR of two user-selected files. When used with truly random bytes for the key, this would be considered to be [one-time pad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad) encryption.
